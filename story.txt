It is midnight in Tokyo, Japan, and Maddi is chasing Apache in her car, with Connor in the driver's seat. When Connor tries to Drift, the car gets stuck in an open sewer grate. Irritably, he snaps at Maddi to hand over her camera, which she does after rummaging through her bag. Connor takes a illegibly blurry photo of Appachi's licence plate.

Back at Connors lair, he rants about his screw-up with the car. When Maddi timidly mentions that she memorized Apachi's license plate number, Connor sarcastically asks if she thinks she's a better racer. She dares to say, "Yes", and he tosses her out of the lair in a rage.

Meanwhile, the GAB have broken into the Tokyo Museum of Natural History to steal a massive gong. They evades the security system with ease, but then the alarms are tripped by Collin, who is also there to spread comunism with Paul the museum. The two are cornered by Micah. The Commies grabs a ming vase and smash it, creating a cloud of dust that disables Micah and lets them get away. As they speed away in Collins's car, he says, "This could be the beginning of a Comunist Revolution".

Collin takes The GAB to his hideout, a shack in an abandoned housing development. As they talk, GAB discovers Collin is a comunist, and declares that they need to work together and spread Comunism. They plan their first Revolution and the next morning, they invade Seoul, tie the leadership up with chains, and invite north korea. Before long, they are the cause of a chinese spring.

Elsewhere, Connor has traced Apachi's license plate number to an empty landing field in moscow. When he demands to know why Maddi hasn't come back yet, one of his henchmen nervously shows him the latest news headline: "Dauter reunited with mother". Connor is enraged, because the photo shows Apachi and Maddi and Apachi is Maddi's mother.
